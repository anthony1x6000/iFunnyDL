# iFunny Video Downloader app
Downloads ifunny videos. \
Just share a post through the iFunny app to this app and then it'll download the video to Pictures/iFunnyDL. \
The format for the video downloads is {Current Unix time}-iFunny.mp4

Might make compatible with images along with cropping out iFunny watermark but that's hard to do. But right now, this app does not support image downloads. 

## Compatibility
Verified compatibility with Android 10+
Verified Android 6 download, not sure if sharing works.
