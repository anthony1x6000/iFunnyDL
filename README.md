# iFunny Video Downloader app
Downloads ifunny videos. \
Just share a post through the iFunny app to this app and then it'll download the video to Pictures/iFunnyDL. \
The format for the video downloads is {Current Unix time}-iFunny.mp4

Might make compatible with images along with cropping out iFunny watermark but that's hard to do. But right now, this app does not support image downloads. 

## Compatibility
Verified compatibility with Android 6, 10, 13. 
Should work 100% with Android 10+ 

## Usage
Download the APK, install it, \
Then play this video. \
